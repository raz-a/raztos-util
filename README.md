 # RazTOS Utilities

 `raztos_util` is a stand-alone, no-std crate that contains useful utilities for embedded
 systems applications.

 These utilities include:
 * Search and Sort Algorithms with low jitter.

 * Dynamic Memory Allocators with controllable sizes and constant time
   (or near constant time) allocations/frees.

 * Common Item collections for efficiently storing structures with low memory footprint.

 * Compile-time CPU feature checks and instruction-set optimized procedures.

 * Synchronization primitives for multi-threaded applications.

 This crate is used by RazTOS as a foundational library.
